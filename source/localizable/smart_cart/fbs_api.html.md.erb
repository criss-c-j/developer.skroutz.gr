# Fulfilled by Skroutz API <%= edit_link %>

Fulfilled by Skroutz API allows Skroutz Merchants to retrieve information about
the purchase orders and related products that are stored in Skroutz warehouses,
as well as create new purchase orders. Moreover, a merchant may access their related
Fullfilled by Skroutz suppliers and create new or update existing ones.

## Setup

In order to be able to use the API, you need to generate an **API token** from within Smart Cart settings

> Creating a new API key will expire any previous one.

## Error handling

In case of errors, the response will have a representative HTTP status code

For example, if you try to view a purchase order that belongs to another shop, you will
get a `401` HTTP status code (Unauthorized), with the following body:

<%= render_code '{
  "errors": [
      {
          "code": "purchase_order_error",
          "messages": [
              "Invalid purchase order"
          ]
      }
  ]
}', 'javascript' %>

If there is no purchase order with the provided code, you will
get a `404` HTTP status code (Not Found), with the same body as above.
